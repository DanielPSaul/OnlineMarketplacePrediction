**Description:** This was the final group project in my Machine Learning course I took during the MSBA program. The purpose of this report is to dive into the data provided by a seller, create an accurate model using machine learning methodologies, and predict the price of a specific product in an online marketplace where buyers and sellers can come together to trade goods and services. The code is included in a Jupyter Notebook and a PDF of the report as well.
